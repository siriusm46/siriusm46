#### Hi there 👋
I'm a _self-learner_ exploring electronics, interested in hardware design and robotics. I’m currently doing projects with **ARM Cortex M3 and AVR**. In my free time, I love working on _Machine Learning_ and make some patterns with data!

Always trying to give **"my STUDENT power"** to Open Source projects by sharing their good points with my friends and writing about them on my blog. (BIG SUPPORTER ⚡)
