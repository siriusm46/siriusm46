#### Hi there 👋
I'm a _self-learner_ exploring electronics, interested in digital hardware design and RISC-V. I’m currently doing projects with Verilog and can not even design a good SPI interface :P . In my free time, I love working on _CRYING_ and make some patterns with my tears!

Always trying to give my **STUDENT power** to Open Source projects by sharing their good points with my friends and writing about them on my blog. (BIG SUPPORTER ⚡)
