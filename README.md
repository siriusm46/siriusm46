### Hi there 👋
I'm a self-learner exploring electronics, interested in hardware design and robotics. I’m currently doing projects with ARM Cortex M3. In my free time, I love working on Machine Learning and make some patterns with data!

I am a supporter of Open Source, and I always try to give "my STUDENT power" to them by sharing their good points with my friends and writing about them on my blog.
