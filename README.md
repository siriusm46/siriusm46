#### Hi there! 👋

I'm a passionate learner and hardware enthusiast exploring the vast world of electronics, with a special focus on digital hardware design and RISC-V.  
Currently, I’m deeply involved in **FPGA design** and enjoy tackling side projects as a **PCB designer**. At work, I contribute to the design of **fiber optic systems**, combining precision engineering with innovation.  

I have a strong enthusiasm for **open source tools** in chip design and love sharing their power with the community, especially with students and fellow learners! This is a big part of why I blog about tech and contribute where I can. But I am a lil shy so I do not share all my work. But I wanna share my knowledge as much as possible. Getting inspired by the bloggers or the other engineers makes me wanna be like them! 

My future goals are to dive into **photonic integrated circuits** and work in cutting-edge environments where **digital and photonics circuits merge**. This is why I constantly learn across multiple fields — from hardware description languages to design fiber optical and laser systems, and more.
