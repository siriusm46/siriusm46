### Hi there 👋
I'm a self-learner exploring electronics, interested in hardware design and robotics. I’m currently doing projects with ARM Cortex M3 and AVR. In my free time, I love working on Machine Learning and make some patterns with data!

I am a supporter of Open Source, and I always try to give "my STUDENT power" to them by sharing their good points with my friends and writing about them on my blog.

My name is not pronounced as Heekret. It sounds like Heejret.  😆

More detailed me:
⭐mineral-stone collector
⭐dried plant (flower and leaf) collector
⭐language freak 🤡
⭐amateur star map artist
